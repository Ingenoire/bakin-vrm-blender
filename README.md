A Blender Addon that allows you to quickly rig and export VRM models for use with RPG Developer Bakin with item hooks and other fixes.
Works for both VRM 0.0 models and VRM 1.0 models.

>**Please make sure that your VRM model is exported with only 2 materials (changed through VRoid Studio's export settings).**

### Features
- Simple and straightforward workflow: no need to touch anything Blender related if you don't want to!
- Automatic item hook bones, so that your character can hold items in engine!
- Creates shape keys for head (tilt head) and eyes (look at), for better emotions in engine!
- Generates a .DEF file through the built-in exporter to automatically import textures into the engine.
- Adjusts the texture names to be easily sorted through in engine.
- Removes VRM 1.0 icosphere.
